Please improve your module as:
- Add more the batch finish on your module
- Must be use function user_save() replace the db_insert()
- At function read_csv: Do you replace the SESSION by another way ?
- array('insert_content_user', array(10)), >> Always only 1 operation insert_content_user. Can you optimize it by split more in here ?
- 'file' => drupal_get_path('module', 'batch_example'), -> the line code is unmeaning
- Please comment the meaningful function. It's mean apply the rule Drupal Convention. Here is the guide: https://www.drupal.org/coding-standards
- Why has this file batch_insert_users.admin.inc ? This file is not support this module. This is the file of Orange project :D
- Line code files[] = batch_insert_users.admin.inc is unmeaning too.
